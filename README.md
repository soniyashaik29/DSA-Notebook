## 📖 Introduction to DSA
<!-- Brief explanation of DSA concepts -->

**Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** form the foundation of computer science.  
They help us store data efficiently and solve problems optimally, making programs run faster and more reliably.

### 🔹 Data Structures
<!-- Examples of common data structures -->

Data structures define how data is stored, organized, and accessed in memory.

- **List** → Sequential data storage  
- **Stack** → Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)  
- **Queue** → First-In-First-Out (FIFO)  
- **Dictionary** → Key-value pair storage  

### 🔹 Algorithms
<!-- Examples of algorithms -->

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve problems.

**Examples:**
- Searching an element  
- Sorting data in required order  
- Finding the shortest path between two nodes
